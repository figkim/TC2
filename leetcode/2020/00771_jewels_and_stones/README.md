## 771. Jewels and Stones

<div><p>You're given strings <code>J</code> representing the types of stones that are jewels, and <code>S</code> representing the stones you have.  Each character in <code>S</code> is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.</p>
<p>The letters in <code>J</code> are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in <code>J</code> and <code>S</code> are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so <code>"a"</code> is considered a different type of stone from <code>"A"</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
</pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> J = "z", S = "ZZ"
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>S</code> and <code>J</code> will consist of letters and have length at most 50.</li>
<li>The characters in <code>J</code> are distinct.</li>
</ul>
