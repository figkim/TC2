## 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

<div><p>Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.</p>
<p>The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A leaf is a node with no children.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Given binary tree <code>[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]</code>,</p>
<pre>    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7</pre>
<p>return its depth = 3.</p>
</div>
