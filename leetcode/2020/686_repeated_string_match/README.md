## 686. Repeated String Match

<div><p>Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.</p>
<p>For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".</p>
<p>Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").</p>
<p><b>Note:</b><br/>
The length of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> will be between 1 and 10000.</p>
</div>
