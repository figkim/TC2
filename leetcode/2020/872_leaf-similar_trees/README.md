## 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

<div><p>Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a <em>leaf value sequence.</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/16/tree.png" style="width: 300px; height: 240px;"/></p>
<p>For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is <code>(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)</code>.</p>
<p>Two binary trees are considered <em>leaf-similar</em> if their leaf value sequence is the same.</p>
<p>Return <code>true</code> if and only if the two given trees with head nodes <code>root1</code> and <code>root2</code> are leaf-similar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both of the given trees will have between <code>1</code> and <code>100</code> nodes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
